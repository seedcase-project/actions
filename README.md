This repository contains GitHub [reusable
workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/reuse-automations/reuse-workflows)
and [actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/get-started/quickstart)
that we use in the Seedcase Project for making our work easier and more
efficient. We also use these workflows in projects that we collaborate
on, such as [ON-LiMiT](https://onlimit.org) and
[DP-Next](https://dp-next.github.io).

Check out our [website](https://actions.seedcase-project.org) for more
information, such as the features it provides and a
[guide](https://actions.seedcase-project.org/docs/guide/) to using the
GitHub actions and workflows. For a list of changes, see our
[changelog](https://actions.seedcase-project.org/docs/releases/) page.
